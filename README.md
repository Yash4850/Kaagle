# Kaagle
This repository contains all of my Kaggle projects. I started doing Kaggle projects to get practical knowledge and to improve my analytical skills at first and later on went on do projects on Neural networks and deep learning as my interest grew more on these topics. https://www.kaggle.com/yashbaby48
Note: I wrote few comments in all the projects so that 'I' can understand and remember easily. These projects are not at professional level.
